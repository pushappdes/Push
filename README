This file contains information regarding access to the Google App Engine account and also details regarding access to the 
QR barcode image.

To access the Google app engine web app we need to go to the link:

http://ropushapptest.appspot.com

To access the QR bar code to download the android app, go to the link:

http://qrcode.kaywa.com/img.php?s=8&d=http%3A%2F%2Fix.cs.uoregon.edu%2F~rohitp%2Fropushapptest-Android.apk

In order to use this web app:

    -> Go to the first link click on "Say Hello" to check if the server is round tripping from Google App Engine. 
  
    -> Next enter the email id of the account which is associated with the android app (the account that you have synced 
       to your phone) in the section where it says "pat@example.com" and enter the text in the "Message" section and click
       "send message". Wallah!!! It should have sent a message to the phone.

In order to downoad and install the app on the phone:

    -> Install a QR barcode reader app such as QRDroid from the android market.(Note you need either
       a Wifi connection or 3G to run android market).
    -> Go to the second link mentioned above and scan the bar code through the Scan button available on the QR barcode app
       and face the camera to get an image of the barcode. Note that the bar code image should be within the rectangle that
       appears on the LCD screen of the phone.
    -> Then this will automatically download the apk link to the barcode reader app and display the link on the screen. 
       Just click on the link and then click on install. This should install the app automatically. 
    -> After this under the options in the downloaded app which opens, click on Accounts and add a google account so that an
       account is associated with the app. Note that the google account you entered should be the same as what is entered
       on the webapp section mentioned above under point 3 of the web app instructions or else the message will not be
       delivered causing an error.
     -> The google app engine account also contains various settings allowing adding developer privileges among others that
        can be seen in the dashboard section.
